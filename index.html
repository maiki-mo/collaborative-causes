          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p><strong>We are a foundation dedicated to prevent the release of any new Adam Sandler movies. For far too long our citizens have had to
            endure these terrible comedies without anyone to protect them. We've had enough of the same terrible jokes and questionable acting.
          We will lobby congress to ban all future Adam Sandler movies from the public. Adam Sandler is a terrible person and we need to protect
        our children from his work. We can no longer stand idly by while this man continues to produce garbage. Join us today and help us in our goal
      to stop this man before it is too late.</strong> </p>

<p class="heading"><strong>How YOU Can Help!<strong></p>
        <p>Every day you wait Adam Sandler gets newer ideas for another awful movie. Over the years Adam Sandler movies have been going downhill and surprisingly we still fall for it. We give him too much credit, expecting a hilarious film from the washed-up Brooklyn actor instead we get a half an hour film without even producing a chuckling. Although Sandler has some ok movies like The Longest Yard, Click, and Little Nicky, it does not motivate me or anyone else with a couple of working brain cells to go see another one of his movies. Luckily, we are all saved as this foundation was created to hopefully help stop this madman by the name of Adam Sandler. With the help of millions, if we generate enough signatures, 100,000 to be exact we can revoke his film license and stop him from filming for the next 10 years. You can also donate to help out our campaign.

    	Please act fast in order to stop Happy Gilmore in his tracks. We don't need another "Grown Ups" film. Can you live with yourself if you had to sit through another Sandler movie starring his regular pals, Rob Schneider, David Spade, John Tuturro, and Jon Lovitz?</p>
