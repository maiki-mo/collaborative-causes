          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>We are a foundation dedicated to prevent the release of any new Adam Sandler movies. For far too long our citizens have had to
            endure these terrible comedies without anyone to protect them. We've had enough of the same terrible jokes and questionable acting. 
          We will lobby congress to ban all future Adam Sandler movies from the public. Adam Sandler is a terrible person and we need to protect 
        our children from his work. We can no longer stand idly by while this man continues to produce garbage. Join us today and help us in our goal
      to stop this man before it is too late. </p>
